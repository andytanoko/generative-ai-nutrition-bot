# 🧠 AI-Powered Nutrition Disorder Specialist Bot (RAG-based)

## 🏥 Business Use Case

### 🔍 Problem Statement

The **Global Nutrition Health Organization**, in partnership with **InnoviTech Solutions**, aims to address the growing complexity of nutritional health diagnosis and management. With an overwhelming volume of dietary literature, medical research, and patient data, clinicians are finding it increasingly difficult to make quick, informed decisions.

To solve this, InnoviTech Solutions has proposed a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**-based chatbot that integrates authoritative resources like the *Nutritional Medical Reference*. The system is designed to provide healthcare professionals with **instant, contextually relevant, and trustworthy insights** on nutritional disorders—significantly improving **diagnostic efficiency** and **patient outcomes**.

## 🎯 Project Objective

As a GenAI Data Scientist at InnoviTech Solutions, your objective is to develop an **Agentic RAG-based system** tailored for the Global Nutrition Health Organization.

This system will:
- Automate the retrieval and summarization of nutritional health knowledge
- Enable clinicians to receive real-time, precise responses about symptoms, diagnoses, and treatment plans
- Improve the credibility and precision of AI-generated medical support content

## ⚙️ Key Components

The solution is built on a **custom, agentic workflow**, incorporating the following stages:

### 🔁 1. Query Expansion
Enhances user queries by expanding them intelligently without changing their meaning. This improves retrieval accuracy and ensures better context coverage.

### 📚 2. Context Retrieval
Retrieves the most relevant medical documents from a **vector store** using the expanded query. This step anchors the chatbot’s responses in authoritative literature.

### ✍️ 3. Response Generation
Generates AI responses strictly based on the retrieved content, ensuring that the information remains grounded, accurate, and reliable.

### 📎 4. Groundedness Evaluation
Verifies the **factual alignment** between the response and the source documents. Ensures that the model does not hallucinate or introduce misleading information.

### 🎯 5. Precision Evaluation
Measures how accurately the response addresses the user's specific query. Ensures the content is **directly useful** and **contextually appropriate**.

### 🔧 6. Response Refinement
Iteratively refines the response to resolve gaps, ambiguities, or lack of clarity based on groundedness and precision feedback.

### 🛠️ 7. Query Refinement
Suggests improvements to the query structure for enhanced future retrievals, completing the feedback loop to continuously improve search and generation quality.
